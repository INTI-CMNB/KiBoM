## Description

Used for components that shouldn't be replaced for a simple equivalent, needs approval.

The config field name is configurable (`fit_field` option).
Its default separator is comma (**,**) which is useful for variants.
Other uses for this field are to mark a component as "Do Not Fit" (do not solder).
This patch also adds the ability to mark it as "Do Not Change".

Valid values to mark it are:
- DNC
- Do Not Change
- No Change
- Fixed

The parser is case insensitive. You can use *DNC*, or *dnc*, or *Dnc*, etc.

DNC components indicates **(DNC)** in the *Quantity Per PCB* column.

## How to use

Add the *DNC* word to the `Config` field.
