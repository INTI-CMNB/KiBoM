## Description

Digi-Key is one of the most complete electronic parts providers. Is often used as a reference.

If you have a field containing the Digi-Key part number you can make its column to contain links to the Digi-Key web page for this component.

## How to use

Define the `digikey_link` option in the configuration file (i.e. `bom.ini`).

The value for this option is the column you want to convert into a link to the Digi-Key.
Note that this field must be a valid Digi-Key part number.
Example:

```
datasheet_as_link = digikey#
```

This will make entries in the column `digikey#` (Digi-Key part number) links to the component's web page.

You can specify more than one fiel name using tab (ASCII 9) as separator:

```
datasheet_as_link = digikey#	digikey_alt#
```

## Limitations

- Only available for HTML.
- Could break if Digi-Key changes it web layout. Please report any problem.
