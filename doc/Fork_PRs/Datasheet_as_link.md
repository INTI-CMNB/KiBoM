# Adds an option to make a column to contain datasheet links

- **Pull-request**: [#79](https://github.com/SchrodingersGat/KiBoM/pull/79)
- **Opened**: 2020-03-11

- **Branch**: datasheet_link

## Description

Having a separated column for the datasheet is an overkill. We can make that another column contains this information as a link. The part number is a suitable column.

This patch allows configuring it.

## How to use

Define the `datasheet_as_link` option in the configuration file (i.e. `bom.ini`).

The value for this option is the column you want to convert into a link to the datasheet. Example:

```
datasheet_as_link = manf#
```

This will make entries in the column `manf#` (manufacturer part number) links to the datasheet.
